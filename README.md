About me
 
  My interests include history, different countries and cultures, and sports (hockey and football).
  
  Websites I recommend
      -I recommend using Google as it is extremely user friendly and allows you to connect your Google account to your search history in case you forgot what it was you were           looking at the         other day.
      -I also recommend watching Youtube, as there are very good history videos on there that allow you to learn more about history in a more fun and engaging way.
